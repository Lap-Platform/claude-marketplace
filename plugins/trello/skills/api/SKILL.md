## Question Mapping

- "How do I create a new board?" -> POST /boards/
- "What cards are on this board?" -> GET /boards/{id}/cards
- "How do I move a card to a different list?" -> PUT /cards/{id} (set `idList`)
- "Who are the members of this board?" -> GET /boards/{id}/members
- "How do I add a comment to a card?" -> POST /cards/{id}/actions/comments
- "How do I search for cards across all boards?" -> GET /search
- "What lists does this board have?" -> GET /boards/{id}/lists
- "How do I create a checklist on a card?" -> POST /cards/{id}/checklists
- "How do I mark a checklist item as complete?" -> PUT /cards/{id}/checkItem/{idCheckItem} (set `state=complete`)
- "How do I add a label to a card?" -> POST /cards/{id}/idLabels
- "How do I assign a member to a card?" -> POST /cards/{id}/idMembers
- "What are my notifications?" -> GET /members/{id}/notifications
- "How do I set up a webhook for board changes?" -> POST /webhooks/
- "How do I archive a list?" -> PUT /lists/{id}/closed (set `value=true`)
- "How do I get the activity log for a board?" -> GET /boards/{boardId}/actions

## Response Tips

- **Boards/Cards/Lists**: All return flat objects with `id` as the primary key. Nested maps like `prefs`, `badges`, and `limits` contain configuration and status sub-objects -- destructure as needed.
- **Actions**: Paginated via `page` param (0-indexed) and `limit` (default 50). The `data` map nests `card`, `board`, and `list` references -- always dereference these for context.
- **Search**: Returns grouped results by model type (`cards`, `boards`, `members`, `organizations`). Each group has its own `_limit` and `_page` params. `partial=true` enables prefix matching.
- **Members**: The `fields` param defaults to `all` which returns a very large object. Prefer specifying only needed fields (`avatarHash,fullName,initials,username`) to reduce payload.
- **Webhooks**: Responses include `consecutiveFailures` and `firstConsecutiveFailDate` -- zero failures and null date indicate a healthy webhook.
- **Enterprise**: Supports cursor-based pagination via `cursor` param on member queries; prefer this over offset pagination for large datasets.
- **Errors**: 401 means invalid or expired auth credentials. 404 means the resource does not exist or the token lacks access to it -- Trello does not distinguish between "not found" and "forbidden" on most endpoints.

## Anomaly Flags

- **Limits approaching**: Surface `limits.*.status` when it equals `"warn"` on any board, card, or member object. The `disableAt` and `warnAt` thresholds indicate attachment, reaction, or other resource caps.
- **Webhook failures**: Alert when `consecutiveFailures > 0` on any webhook -- Trello will deactivate webhooks after repeated failures. Check `firstConsecutiveFailDate` to gauge severity.
- **Closed/archived resources**: Flag when `closed: true` on boards, lists, or cards that the user is trying to interact with -- write operations may silently succeed on archived items.
- **Missing auth**: Both `key` and `token` query params are required for all requests. Surface immediately if either is absent, as all calls will return 401.
- **Enterprise deactivation**: Watch for non-empty `idEnterprisesDeactivated` arrays on member objects -- the member may have restricted access.
- **Due date overdue**: When `due` is in the past and `dueComplete` is `false`, proactively flag the card as overdue.
- **Rate limiting**: Trello enforces per-token rate limits (typically 100 requests per 10-second window per token, 300 per 10 seconds per key). Surface 429 responses and suggest backing off.

## Playbook

### 1. Create a Board with Lists and Initial Cards

1. `POST /boards/` with `name`, `defaultLists=false`, and desired `prefs_permissionLevel`
2. Note the returned board `id`
3. `POST /boards/{id}/lists` for each list (e.g., "To Do", "In Progress", "Done"), setting `pos` to control order
4. `POST /cards` for each initial card, setting `idList` to the appropriate list `id`
5. Optionally `POST /boards/{id}/labels` to create project-specific labels

### 2. Set Up a Webhook to Monitor Board Activity

1. `GET /members/me/tokens` to retrieve the current token ID
2. `POST /webhooks/` with `idModel` set to the board `id` and `callbackURL` pointing to your endpoint
3. Verify the webhook is active: `GET /webhooks/{id}` and confirm `active: true` and `consecutiveFailures: 0`
4. To stop monitoring: `DELETE /webhooks/{id}`

### 3. Manage a Card Through Its Lifecycle

1. `POST /cards` with `idList` (backlog list), `name`, `desc`, and optional `idMembers` and `idLabels`
2. Add a checklist: `POST /cards/{id}/checklists` then `POST /checklists/{id}/checkItems` for each task
3. Move to active: `PUT /cards/{id}` with `idList` set to the "In Progress" list
4. Complete checklist items: `PUT /cards/{id}/checkItem/{idCheckItem}` with `state=complete`
5. Add a comment on completion: `POST /cards/{id}/actions/comments` with summary text
6. Archive the card: `PUT /cards/{id}` with `closed=true`

### 4. Bulk Search and Triage Across Boards

1. `GET /search` with `query` describing the issue, `modelTypes=cards`, and `cards_limit=25`
2. For each result card, `GET /cards/{id}` with `members=true` and `checklists=all` to assess status
3. Reassign or relabel as needed: `PUT /cards/{id}` with updated `idMembers` or `idLabels`
4. Add triage comments: `POST /cards/{id}/actions/comments`
5. Use `GET /batch` with comma-separated URLs to fetch multiple cards in a single request when triaging many items

### 5. Invite Members and Configure Board Permissions

1. `PUT /boards/{id}/members` with the member's `email` and desired `type` (admin/normal/observer)
2. Verify membership: `GET /boards/{id}/memberships` and check the new member appears
3. Adjust board visibility: `PUT /boards/{id}` with `prefs_permissionLevel` (private/org/public)
4. To remove a member: `DELETE /boards/{id}/members/{idMember}`
5. For organization-wide invites: `PUT /organizations/{id}/members` with `email`, `fullName`, and `type`


## Response Tips
- Check response schemas in references/api-spec.lap for field details
- List endpoints may support pagination; check for limit, offset, or cursor params
- Create/update endpoints typically return the created/updated object
